# benniger_tf_regulators
An analysis of binding sites for nfat tfs in genes provided by Richard Benniger

With the provided gene lists

1. Run Homer to find enrichment of TF binding sites
2. Run Fimo to identify bindig sites within those genes
3. Find conservation in these regions using UCSC genome browser
4. Create output file that contains TF binding sites ordered by conservation score.
